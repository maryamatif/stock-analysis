# ANALYSIS OF GREEN STOCKS FOR YEARS 2017 AND 2018
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this VBA exercise was to analyze several environmental friendly stock options. We looked at the share prices and total shares outstanding to evaluate how each stock performed for the two years. 
This gave us insight into the company performance and the data could be used to figure out which stocks to invest in.

## Results
Overall, we can see that the stocks performed much worse in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2018, there are only two stocks that gave a positive return (ENPH and RUN) while in 2017, we had 10 stocks that gave us healthy reutrns at the end of the year.
The poor performance in 2018 could've been for internal (company specific) or external (economy contracting etc.) reasons. 
We can also evaluate the execution times of the original and the refactored codes. The original code that included several loops took 0.79 seconds to execute while
the refactored code only took about 0.16 seconds. The shows that editing the nesting order of your loops, improvine the logic and adding fewer steps to your code can signifcantly reduce the execution time and make the code more time efficient to run.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
### Advantages
1. Eliminating unnecessary steps reduces the chances of errors or bugs in your code.
2. The refactored code can be much quicker to run. This shows especially when you're dealing with large data sets.
3. Making the code more efficient and clean can also makes it easier for others to understand your code.
### Disadvantages
1. Refactoring can take alot of time as you have to find creative ways to make the code more efficient. This can be a problem when you're working on time constrained projects.
2. It can also make the code more complicated and add extra errors if you don't refactor very carefully. 

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
It definitely took alot of time to refactor, particularly because I wasn't used to the application and had just started learning the VBA language. It also meant introducing alot
of new errors in my code that took alot of time to debug. However, once it was sorted and the code ran smoothly, we could see that the time taken to run the refactored 
was much shorter than the orginial code. It was also much more easier to understand and was shorter in length. That would help me understand the file much more quickly in the future.
